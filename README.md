This code contains several classes and subclasses which work together to create a fully functional tetris game. The class TetrisBrick is the super class for all the sub bricks ElBrick, 
JayBrick, EssBrick, LongBrick, StackBrick, ZeeBrick, SquareBrick. The class TetriSLeaderboard contains the functionality to check a user's score and insert it into the top 10 highest scores if it
was higher than any of the previous 10 highest scores. The class TetrisGame contains all the logic for the game, determining whether a user has reached the limit of the board or whether he has 
completed a full row, thereby removing that row. The class TetrisDisplay is responsible for creating the display of the game. The class TetrisWindow is responsible for bringing all the components together 
on a window.
